	<title>Instant Deployment and Scalability of Blazing Fast PostgreSQL - Diamanti</title>
<p>
  With the growing Kubernetis adoption and community contribution, Kubernetes has evolved as the leading platform for every type of application, including stateful applications. In fact, in a <a href="https://diamanti.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Diamanti_2019_Container_Survey.pdf">recent Diamanti survey </a> of IT decision-makers, databases emerged as one of the top container use cases. A lot of improvements from the Kubernetes community, such as storage class, persistent volumes (PV), and container storage interface (CSI), have helped accelerate the deployment of stateful applications on Kubernetes. The operator framework has further greatly simplified stateful application deployment. However, stateful application management requires complex, multistep processes for provisioning, failover, backup/restore, and many other tasks, in addition to the Kubernetes provided constructs. The performance achieved by applications is bound by the underlying infrastructure.

<p>
  The Diamanti platform not only simplifies the stateful application deployment and management by inherently supporting easy provisioning and providing many essential data services but also supercharges them to achieve extreme performance. Some examples of stateful applications include databases, messaging queues, cache, and object-store. In this blog, we will focus on the benefits of deploying <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> on the Diamanti platform.
